# Algorithms-in-Python
Different types of algorithms written in Python code. 

Will be added in the near future with different sorting and searching Algorithms including selection sort, merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort, linear search, binery search.

I will make them into functions later on and improve it. But for now I'm just keeping it as "if it works and fits the algorithm rule, it's good"

I'm not so good at coding so you might not want to use this in your code, this is just an opportunity for me to learn algorithms and review python.

Feel free to message me and tell me if either my code has errors or if my interpretation of the algorithm is incorrect.

###FINISHED:
Selection Sort - Inefficient (usually used daily for finding the smallest item)
Insertion Sort (card shuffle - this is how you would sort your cards)
